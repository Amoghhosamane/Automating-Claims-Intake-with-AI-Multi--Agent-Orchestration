# Automating-Claims-Intake-with-AI-Multi--Agent-Orchestration

This idea uses multiple AI agents working together to process insurance claims faster. One agent checks if details are complete, another finds damage severity, another checks for duplicates, and one estimates the amount. A main agent compiles everything and writes the required emails. It saves time and improves claim accuracy.
