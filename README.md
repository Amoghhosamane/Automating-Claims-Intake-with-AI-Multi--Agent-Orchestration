AI Multi-Agent System for Automated FNOL Processing
Overview

Insurance companies receive thousands of FNOL (First Notice of Loss) emails daily, making manual processing slow, error-prone, and costly.
This project proposes an AI multi-agent orchestration system that collaboratively processes FNOL emails to accelerate claim handling, improve accuracy, and reduce human workload.

Solution

The system uses multiple specialized AI agents, each responsible for a specific task in the FNOL workflow:

Completeness Agent – Verifies whether all required claim details are present

Damage Severity Agent – Assesses the severity of reported damage

Duplicate Detection Agent – Identifies and flags duplicate claims

Estimation Agent – Predicts claim amount based on available data

Orchestrator Agent – Aggregates outputs from all agents and generates required emails and summaries

This collaborative approach enables faster, consistent, and more reliable claim processing.

Problem Statement

Insurance FNOL processing faces several challenges:

Missing or incomplete claim information

Manual triage leading to slow processing times

Lack of consistent damage severity evaluation

Duplicate claims going unnoticed

Unpredictable and inaccurate claim estimations

Opportunities

By leveraging AI Multi-Agent Orchestration, insurers can:

Automate FNOL intake and initial claim assessment

Significantly reduce human workload

Improve claim accuracy and consistency

Enhance customer experience through faster responses

Impact

This system transforms FNOL handling from a manual bottleneck into an intelligent, scalable, and automated workflow, enabling insurers to process claims efficiently at scale.
