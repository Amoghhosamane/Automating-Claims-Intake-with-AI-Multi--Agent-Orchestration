# AI Multi-Agent System for Automated FNOL Processing
(Low-Code / No-Code Implementation using Microsoft Copilot Agents)

## Project Summary
This project implements an AI-driven multi-agent orchestration system to automate
FNOL (First Notice of Loss) insurance claim intake using a low-code / no-code approach
with Microsoft Copilot Agents.

The solution leverages multiple specialized Copilot agents to validate claim data,
assess damage severity, detect duplicate claims, estimate claim amounts, and generate
automated email responses, significantly reducing manual processing effort.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Low-Code / No-Code AI Development
- Microsoft Copilot Agents
- AI Agent Orchestration
- Process Automation
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- OCR-Based Document Processing
- InsurTech Solutions
- Enterprise Workflow Automation

---

## Business Problem
Insurance organizations receive high volumes of FNOL emails daily.
Manual claim triage introduces:

- Delays in claim processing
- Incomplete or missing claim information
- Inconsistent damage severity evaluation
- Undetected duplicate claims
- Poor customer experience

---

## Solution Approach
A modular multi-agent architecture built using Microsoft Copilot Agents,
where each agent performs a specific FNOL processing task.

### Copilot Agents Involved
- Completeness Agent
  - Validates presence of mandatory FNOL fields using prompts and rules

- Damage Severity Agent
  - Classifies damage severity from textual descriptions or images

- Duplicate Detection Agent
  - Identifies similar or duplicate claims using AI-based similarity matching

- Estimation Agent
  - Estimates claim amounts based on historical patterns and extracted data

- Orchestrator Agent
  - Coordinates all agents and compiles structured claim summaries
  - Generates automated customer and internal email responses

---

## System Workflow
1. FNOL email ingestion
2. OCR and text extraction (if required)
3. Parallel execution of Copilot agents
4. Aggregation and validation of agent outputs
5. Automated response and reporting

---

## Technology Stack
- Microsoft Copilot Agents
- Microsoft Power Platform (Power Automate, Power Apps)
- Azure AI Services
- OCR and document intelligence tools
- Email automation connectors
- Low-Code / No-Code orchestration workflows

---

## Quantifiable Impact
- Reduced FNOL triage time
- Lower dependency on manual claim review
- Improved data completeness and consistency
- Faster customer communication
- Scalable enterprise-ready solution

---

## Future Scope
- Integration with insurance core systems (Guidewire, Duck Creek)
- Computer vision-based damage assessment
- Fraud detection using anomaly detection
- Human-in-the-loop validation for high-risk claims
- Multilingual FNOL processing
- Cloud-scale deployment across regions

---

## Hackathon Value Proposition
- Real-world enterprise insurance use case
- Demonstrates applied AI using low-code/no-code tools
- Rapid development and scalability
- Aligns with enterprise digital transformation goals

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how low-code / no-code AI multi-agent orchestration using
Microsoft Copilot Agents can modernize FNOL processing, delivering faster, more
accurate, and scalable insurance workflows.
